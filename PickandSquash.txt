here what is pick and squash is like the concept is like

-> for example if we have some 4 commits and if we want to make them as single commit what we will do is that we will take the hashcode below that 4 commits and reset and then the 4 commit changes will be 
unstaged then we can make the new commit as final commit.

-> another method is by using the pick and squash method

commands are : 

git rebase -i (hashcode below what we need to squash)    -> here -i means the interactive environment

after this we will get some interactive environment page and there we can see the commits above the given hashcode and there it will be [pick a12cx 1] like this 4 time will be there 
if we want to squash the we remove the pick and write s
