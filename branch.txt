now we are modified the readme file and we should never commit on the main branch so we are creating hte new branch here 

git branch hari  --> this will create a branch called hari
git checkout hari --> this will now the head pointer point to the hari branch not in the main branch


now if we do the commits then it will commit on the seperate branch that is called hari from now onwards
